# Glados
This is me learning graphics programming by building my own renderer using OpenGL and ImGui. Most of this code can be found at: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel

# Build Instructions

- Start by cloning the repository with git clone `git clone --recursive https://github.com/msunde137/Glados/tree/master`
- Run GenerateGlados.bat to make the project files

# Features:

- 2D/3D rendering pipeline in OpenGL
- Testing framework
- GUI by ImGUI
