# Glados
This is me learning graphics programming by building my own renderer using OpenGL and ImGui. Most of this code is pulled directly from: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel

This project only supports Windows right now, but I want to add Mac and Linux at some point!

# Build Instructions

- Start by cloning the repository with git clone `git clone --branch FinalProject --recursive https://github.com/msunde137/Glados`
- Run GenerateGlados.bat to make the project files

# Features:

- 2D/3D rendering pipeline in OpenGL
- Testing framework
- GUI by ImGUI
